    <p>I have owned a <b>Checkpoint Gravel Bicycle</b> since the summer of 2018. This was a part
        of my journey into <strong>endurance cycling</strong>. At the time I bought it, I was training to ride
         a century - a 100 mile ride. The version that I have is carbon fiber, it is extremely light.
         It has held up over time, I have put thousands of miles on this bicycle.
