<h3>The Vixen</h3>
<p>The Vixen used to be a movie theater in McHenry. It is by the Fox river on Green Street
I have seen several bands there. My favorites in this area are Jagged Little Pill, My Metal Heart, and
Bad Motor Scooter. My husband and I like to meet our friends at these location, listen to the live music,
and dance to it. We are very enthusiastic and amuse other people at the concerts.
